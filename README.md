```bash
go mod tidy
```

3. Build the application:

1. **Install Components**: Start by installing PHP, Composer, MySQL, Caddy, and Git
2. **Create Laravel Sites**: Set up new Laravel applications with domain configuration
3. **Manage Sites**: Update existing sites and manage deployments
4. **Monitor System**: Check service status and site health
5. **Backup Data**: Create and transfer MySQL backups

### Navigation

- Use **â†‘/â†“** or **k/j** to navigate the menu
- Press **Enter** or **Space** to select an option
- Press **q** or **Ctrl+C** to quit

## Laravel Site Structure

Sites are created in `/var/www/[site-name]` with proper permissions:
- Owner: `www-data:www-data`
- Directories: `755`
- Files: `644`
- Storage/Cache: `775`

## Caddy Configuration

Crucible creates optimized Caddy configurations for Laravel:

- PHP-FPM integration with Unix sockets
- Security headers (XSS, CSRF protection)
- Gzip compression
- Static file serving
- Laravel-specific URL rewriting

### Configuration Files

- Main Caddyfile: `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile`
- Laravel snippet: `/etc/caddy/snippets/laravel.caddy`
- Site configs: `/etc/caddy/sites/[domain].caddy`

## MySQL Best Practices

Crucible configures MySQL with security best practices:
- Runs `mysql_secure_installation`
- Enables automatic startup
- Optimizes for Laravel workloads

## Development

The project is structured as follows:

- `main.go`: Main application and UI logic
- `install.go`: Component installation functions
- `laravel.go`: Laravel site management
- `utils.go`: Backup, status, and utility functions

### Dependencies

- [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea): TUI framework
- [Lipgloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss): Terminal styling
- [Charm Log](https://github.com/charmbracelet/log): Structured logging

## Security Considerations

- Always run with appropriate privileges
- Secure MySQL installations with strong passwords
- Configure firewalls appropriately
- Use HTTPS in production with proper SSL certificates
- Regularly update system packages and PHP versions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Denied**: Ensure you're running with sudo privileges
2. **Package Not Found**: Update package repositories before installation
3. **Service Start Failures**: Check system logs with `journalctl`
4. **Caddy Configuration Errors**: Validate syntax with `caddy validate`

### Logs

Crucible uses structured logging. Check the output for detailed information about operations and any errors encountered.

### System Status

Use the "System Status" option in the menu to check:
- Service installation status
- Service health
- Available Laravel sites
- Disk usage
